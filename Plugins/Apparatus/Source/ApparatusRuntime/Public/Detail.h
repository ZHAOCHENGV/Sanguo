 * The base subjective data block class.

 * Details are high-level components which
 * are basically Unreal Engine's Objects (@c UObject).
 *
 * These are stored within subjectives and are
 * iterated through the caching belts.
 * 
 * Details (unlike traits) support the OOP-like inheritance
 * model and can also have multiple instances
 * of the same class assigned for each subjective.
 * 
 * New detail instances are enabled by default.
